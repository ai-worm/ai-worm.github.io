# Who is AI Worm?

**Ai Worm** is an individual with an interest in programming and story writing, all while dabbling in the art of illustration and photo manipulation. In lame-mens terms, he is a programmer and a story writer or a content creator as you would say.

## The History of The Name

Like all names, there is a story behind the meaning. You could say that the name is a combination of the words "ai" and "worm", where "ai" is the word for "artificial intelligence" and "worm" is the word that represents his personality or actual name.

But you would be wrong. It was indeed inspired by the term Artificial Intelligence, a concept that has intrigued his mind the moment he first heard the words, "Machine Learning".

However it came to be known that at the time of his childhood, man and machine were still far from the fantasy world where the two were equal.

As such he decided to bring forth the stories of RoboCop, Astro boy, Iron Man and Sym-Bionic Titan to life. (I made sure to purposely not include Generator Rex and Ben 10 because they are obviously a given.)

The name of this project, a dream which has yet to fully emerge to the world is none other than "Allinventor". A word so simple that it literally means "Creator of All".

Taking the initials of this goal and combing them together with his real life initials he got the name "AI Worm".

As for what "worm" spells... let's just say that it is the word that represents his personality without his parents ever realizing the secret of the name they have given him.

Truthfully, almost no being in existence knows his full name apart form his immediate family members. A blessing that keeps he keeps from spreading. Why? Because people just forget and it makes an interesting conversation in his mind.

## Last Question... IS HE SANE?

No, in fact, he is not sane. He is in truth the most insane and dangerous person in the world.

Why? Because I say so.
